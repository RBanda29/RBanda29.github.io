<h1>Child Labor </h1>
<h3>
  The Great Deppresion/ Industrial Revolution 
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Industrial Revolution saw the rise of actories in need of workers. Children were ideal employees because 
         they could be paid less, were often of smaller stature so could attend to more minute tasks and were less likely 
         to organize and strike against their pitiable working conditions.</li>
  <li>Working children were unable to attend school—creating a cycle of poverty that was difficult to break. </li>
  <li>Miserable working conditions including crowded and unclean factories, a lack of safety codes or legislation and 
         long hours were the norm. </li>
  <li>Immigration to the United States led to a high amount of child labor. When the Irish Famine struck in the 1840's
         Irish immigrants and children moved to fill lower-level factory jobs. In the 1880s, groups from southern and 
         eastern Europe arrived, provided a new pool of child workers.</li>
  <li>Educational reformers of the mid-nineteenth century attempted to convince the public that a primary school 
         education was a necessity if the nation were to advance as a whole. Several states established a minimum 
         wage for labor and requirements for school attendance—though many of these laws were full of loopholes that 
         were readily exploited by employers hungry for cheap labor.</li>
  <li>From 1902 to 1915, child labor committees emphasized reform through state legislatures. Many laws restricting 
         child labor were passed as part of the progressive reform movement of this period. But many southern states 
         resisted, leading to the decision to work for a federal child labor law. While Congress passed such laws in 
         1916 and 1918, the Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional.</li>
