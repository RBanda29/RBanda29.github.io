    <h3>
      History of Child Labor
    </h3>
    <p>
      Child labor, or the use of children as servants and apprentices, has been
      practiced throughout most of human history, but became more prevalent
      during the Industrial Revolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Industrial Revolution saw the rise of factories in need of workers.
      Children were ideal employees because they could be paid less, were often
      of smaller stature so could attend to more minute tasks and were less
      likely to organize and strike against their pitiable working conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Income Inequality
    </h3>

    <p>
      A greater dispersion of income leads to a greater quantity of poorer
      households which would increase the incidence of child labor. Therefore,
      the relationship between income inequality and child labor is expected to
      be positive for high income countries.
